#Better minecart rotation

**lock-minecart-view**
Minecraft mod using Fabric

I hate when the minecart turn under me, but without me...
So ... I've made this to solve the problem :D

The project is on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minecart-direction-follow)(download)

Toggle key is F7 because [First Person Model](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/first-person-model)'s toggle is F6
